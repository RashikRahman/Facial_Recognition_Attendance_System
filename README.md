# Facial_Recognition_Attendance_System

This is an automation of face recognition attendance system. This project is with out gui so 
there's a loop whole in taking the attendance that I intentionally didn't resolve as I'll develop a 
gui interface on it in near future. You may resolve that loop whole with a simple logic of 'if preson name exists in csv then don't save else save'.

## How to run?
**At first** you'll need to install Visual Studio c++ compiler. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAoIqnNia4) to see how to 
download and install Visual Studio c++ compiler.
Follow this tutorial till installation. After the installation finishes
you close the installation window you don't need to open or configure Visual Studio 
as shown in the tutorial.


**Next** You need to locate to the directory where you clone this repo. You can use command promt
or anaconda powershell. To locate to repo you just need to type in this command
```ini
cd 'path to repo'
```
After that type in the following command.

```ini
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Now you have installed all the dependencies. So just open the Face_Attendance.py file and run it.
**Make sure** you have a webcam attached to your device.

## Here's an output demo.
